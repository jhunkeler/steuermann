This is mail I sent to the u-rel list.  It can be a start on docs.


Steuermann is a tool to execute interdependent tasks on multiple machines.  The main point is to define a command to run on some machine, but also to state that it happens after some other commands that may be on that machine or other machines.  The program "smc" analyzes the dependencies and then uses ssh (or something similar) to execute the commands in the right order.

The .sm file that Christine wrote ( https://trac.assembla.com/u-rel/browser/build/trunk/steuermann/build_ur.sm ) does not expect you to put scripts on the target machine for you.  The command on line 4 (build_UR/setup) runs on every machine that you will build on; it gets the scripts needed by using "svn export".

It assumes a shared file system to store the source code on.  The commands on line 9 (build_UR/make_source_tar_urel) and 12 (build_UR/make_source_tar_iraf) create tar files of the source code.  All the other builds begin with those source tar files.  The main point here is to have the same source code built on all the platforms.


I don't have any docs for steuermann yet, so here is an outline of the syntax of the sm file:

It defines a set of commands to be executed.  Each command has a name.  The fully qualified command name is host:tablename/commandname.  host is the machine where the command will run.  tablename is which table the command is part of (the table name identifies which table in the report; it helps to have multiple tables when you have many entries, but Christine does not have many entries yet).  commandname is a name that identifies the command.

TABLE tablename HOST hostlist

insert the following commands into table "tablename" and run them on every host in hostlist.  TABLE is followed by one or more CMD directives.

CMD cmdname RUN "command string"

define a command named "cmdname"; to perform this command use "command string".  CMD is followed by zero or more AFTER clauses.

CMD cmdname LOCAL "command string"

define a command, but instead of running it on the designated host, run it locally on behalf of that host.  If you use this in a table that has 5 hosts in the hostlist, the command will run 5 times on the local machine.  It will know which host you are running it for, so, for example, it can be a command to copy files to that machine.

AFTER othercmdname

states that this command must be executed after othercmdname is finished.  You can list as many AFTER clauses as you want.  Redundant AFTER clauses do not hurt anything.  In an AFTER clause, you can use a partially qualified command name.  "AFTER xxx" means 'after command xxx for this machine finishes'.  You can also use wildcards:

AFTER *:x/y means after command x/y finishes on _every_ host.

AFTER x/* means after every command in table x finishes on this host.

AFTER *:x/* means after every command in table x finishes on every host.


The main reason I wrote steuermann is the complex builds I do for SSB.  I have cross-host dependencies.  For example, I build STSDAS only on 32 bit machines, then copy the result to 64 bit machines.  The interesting parts of the SM config for that look like this:

TABLE build HOST herbert bond
        CMD dev.stsci_iraf RUN "build_stsci_iraf dev"
                AFTER init/*
                AFTER *:assemble/dev.stsci_iraf
                AFTER build/dev.axe

TABLE build HOST thor arzach
        CMD dev.stsci_iraf_64hack RUN "build_stsci_iraf_64hack dev herbert"
        AFTER herbert:build/dev.stsci_iraf*

TABLE build HOST cadeau banana
        CMD dev.stsci_iraf_64hack RUN "build_stsci_iraf_64hack dev bond"
        AFTER bond:build/dev.stsci_iraf*


This means I run herbert:build/dev.stsci_iraf and bond:build/dev.stsci_iraf to compile iraf.  After that finishes, I run thor:build/dev.stsci_iraf_64hack to copy the built files to thor from herbert, cadeau:build/dev.stsci_iraf_64hack to copy the files to cadeau from bond, etc etc.

smc understands that it can run more than one command on each machine, so it can do this concurrently, up to the limit for concurrent tasks defined in hosts.ini

There are bunches of other details that I'll have to describe some time.
